    "## WinBoat High-Level Data Flow Overview\n",
    "This analysis outlines the core architectural components and their interactions within the `winboat` project, optimized for diagram generation. The project's hybrid client-server and containerized virtualization nature is emphasized, focusing on the communication between the Electron host application and the containerized Windows guest.\n",
    "### Central Modules/Functions\n",
    "The following modules and functions are central to the project's operation, identified from the provided Control Flow Graph data:\n",
    "*   **Electron Application Lifecycle & Window Management:**\n",
    "    *   `main.app.on('activate') callback`: Handles application activation events, typically leading to window creation or restoration.\n",
    "    *   `main.app.on('window-all-closed') callback`: Manages the application's behavior when all windows are closed (e.g., quitting the app).\n",
    "    *   `main.createWindow`: Responsible for initializing and displaying new Electron browser windows.\n",
    "    *   `main.then() callback`: Likely part of an asynchronous flow, possibly related to application initialization or VM startup.\n",
    "*   **Guest Server Utilities:**\n",
    "    *   `guest_server.util.checkErr`: A utility function for error handling within the Go-based guest server.\n",
    "    *   `guest_server.util.copyFile`: Handles file copying operations within the guest server environment.\n",
    "### Logical Component Groupings\n",
    "The project is structured around five primary components, each with distinct responsibilities, suitable for clear visual boundaries in a diagram:\n",
    "1.  **Electron Host Application**\n",
    "    *   **Description:** The user-facing desktop application built with Electron. It provides the graphical user interface, orchestrates the virtualization process, and manages the lifecycle of the Windows VM.\n",
    "    *   **Responsibilities:** User interaction, GUI display, VM lifecycle management (start/stop), communication with backend services, and integration with remote display.\n",
    "    *   **Source Files:** `main.ts` (inferred from `main` prefix in CFG)\n",
    "2.  **Virtualization Manager (Docker/KVM)**\n",
    "    *   **Description:** The backend component responsible for provisioning, managing, and interacting with the Docker container that hosts the Windows Virtual Machine, leveraging KVM for hardware virtualization.\n",
    "    *   **Responsibilities:** Creating/destroying VM containers, managing VM resources, starting/stopping VMs, and network configuration for the guest.\n",
    "    *   **Source Files:** (Not directly visible in CFG, but expected in a `backend` or `docker` related directory)\n",
    "3.  **Windows Virtual Machine (Guest OS)**\n",
    "    *   **Description:** The virtualized Windows operating system running within a Docker container, managed by KVM. This is the environment where Windows applications execute.\n",
    "    *   **Responsibilities:** Hosting the WinBoat Guest Server, running Windows applications, and providing the environment for remote display.\n",
    "    *   **Source Files:** (Represents the entire guest OS, not a specific source file)\n",
    "4.  **WinBoat Guest Server**\n",
    "    *   **Description:** A custom Go-based server application running inside the Windows Virtual Machine. It acts as a critical bridge, enabling communication and control between the Electron Host Application and the guest Windows environment.\n",
    "    *   **Responsibilities:** Executing commands within the guest OS, facilitating file transfers, reporting guest status, and interacting with the FreeRDP server component.\n",
    "    *   **Source Files:** `guest_server/util.go` (inferred from `guest_server.util` prefix in CFG)\n",
    "5.  **FreeRDP Client**\n",
    "    *   **Description:** The component responsible for establishing and managing the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection. It enables the seamless display of Windows applications on the Linux host.\n",
    "    *   **Responsibilities:** Initiating RDP sessions, rendering remote application windows, and handling user input (keyboard/mouse) for remote applications.\n",
    "    *   **Source Files:** (Not directly visible in CFG, but expected in a `freerdp` or `integration` related directory)\n",
    "### Component Relationships and Interactions\n",
    "The following relationships define the data flow and control pathways between the components:\n",
    "*   **Electron Host Application -> Virtualization Manager (Docker/KVM)**\n",
    "    *   **Relationship:** Orchestrates VM Lifecycle\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow:** `Start VM Command`, `Stop VM Command`, `VM Configuration Parameters`\n",
    "*   **Virtualization Manager (Docker/KVM) -> Windows Virtual Machine (Guest OS)**\n",
    "    *   **Relationship:** Hosts & Manages\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow:** `VM Boot Signal`, `Resource Allocation`, `Network Configuration`\n",
    "*   **Windows Virtual Machine (Guest OS) -> WinBoat Guest Server**\n",
    "    *   **Relationship:** Executes Within\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow:** `OS Environment`, `File System Access`\n",
    "*   **Electron Host Application <-> WinBoat Guest Server**\n",
    "    *   **Relationship:** Command & Control / Status Reporting\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow (Host to Guest):** `Execute Guest Command`, `Request File Transfer`\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow (Guest to Host):** `Guest Status Update`, `File Transfer Confirmation`\n",
    "*   **Electron Host Application <-> FreeRDP Client**\n",
    "    *   **Relationship:** Manages Remote Session\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow:** `Initiate RDP Session`, `Display Remote Application`\n",
    "*   **FreeRDP Client <-> WinBoat Guest Server**\n",
    "    *   **Relationship:** RDP Communication\n",
    "    *   **Data Flow:** `RDP Protocol Data (Screen Updates)`, `User Input Events (Keyboard/Mouse)\n",
